# Tobermory-Day-1
We had packed everything before we headed for tobermory.
The cottage was quite small, mostly because we were not allowed to go the basement.
So anyway we got there we unpacked ate dinner. Then we went to 'Little Tub Harbor'. We saw a lot of 5cm rock fishs, But we saw a 10-15cm fish.
Later we went to 'Big tub harbor' We only saw tiny fish.

Finally i went to sleep.
